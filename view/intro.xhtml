    To join this pool, all you need is a namecoin address where we can
    send you your reward. You use this address instead of a username for
    your miner, the password has to be "none" (without quotation marks).
  </p>
  <p>
    A way to get a new address to use is with
    <code>namecoind getaccountaddress ""</code>

  <h2>Rates</h2>
  <p>
    Our Numero Uno priority is protecting your namecoins (NMC). For that reason, we monitor every payout manually with full paranoia.  Payouts should appear within a few blocks of the found block.
  </p>
  <p>
    49 shares are awarded based on the number of shares your miner submitted to the
    pool since the last block the pool won (a "round")<br>
    We sum your non-stale, unrejected shares since the last time we found a block, and distribute proportionally among all participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    To cover the ongoing costs for this service, the pool keeps 1 coin of the reward
    per generated block.
