  <h2>Pooled mining</h2>
  <p>
    Namecoins are mined by finding blocks, the finder receives 50 namecoins for
    their effort, while everybody else doesn't see any reward.
    Additionally, the difficulty of finding blocks increases as more people
    join the mining effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pooled mining is a joined effort that combines the resources of many people
    to find a block together, and share the reward in a fair distribution.
